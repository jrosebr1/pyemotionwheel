      "This is clearly a hard time for you, and I want to commend you for sharing your feelings and experiences. By identifying your emotions, you've already taken a significant step towards understanding your emotional response to this situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Tracing Back to Root Emotions\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with **sadness**, it seems to be a primary emotion here. The breakup has left you feeling sad and downcast. This is not surprising, as you've lost something significant in your life. Sadness is a natural response to loss. The fact that you're also experiencing **depression** and **despair** tells me that this sadness is deep and pervasive. You're feeling the weight of the loss, and it's impacting your daily life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to **anger**, this emotion is often a response to feeling wronged or slighted. You mention feeling **rage** and **frustration**, which could be directed towards the situation, your ex-partner, or even yourself. It's important to remember that anger, while uncomfortable, is a natural response to hurt and loss. It's a way of protecting ourselves from the pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, you mentioned feeling **confused**. This is likely stemming from the surprise or shock of the breakup. You are searching for reasons, trying to make sense of what happened. This is a normal part of processing a sudden change or loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Deepening Understanding of Emotions\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's now move deeper into these emotions, exploring the children nodes to better understand what you're feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with **sadness**, you've identified feelings of **suffering**, **despondent**, **disappointed**, **shameful**, **neglected**, and **despair**. These emotions suggest a profound sense of loss and a struggle with self-worth. You may feel like you've lost a part of yourself, and you're grappling with feelings of rejection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under **anger**, you've identified **rage** and **frustration**. These intense feelings may be a response to a perceived unfairness or a violation of your expectations. You may feel betrayed, which could be fueling your anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under **confusion**, there is **disillusionment**. This emotion speaks to a loss of innocence or a shattering of your expectations. This can be a difficult emotion to navigate as it often comes with a sense of disappointment and a loss of trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Advice Moving Forward\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, it's okay to feel these intense emotions. They are a normal part of the grieving process after a significant loss. Acknowledge your feelings without judgment. Allow yourself to feel them fully, but try not to get swept away by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you feel ready, consider expressing your feelings through a creative outlet. You mentioned your guitar and writing. Use these as tools to channel your emotions and to heal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, it's okay to seek support. Reach out to friends and family, or consider speaking to a mental health professional. They can provide you with strategies to manage your emotions and navigate this difficult time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take care of your physical health. Exercise, eat well, and try to get adequate sleep. These things can significantly impact your emotional well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, be patient with yourself. Healing takes time. Allow yourself to move through this at your own pace. There's no right or wrong way to grieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, you're not alone. It's okay to ask for help. You're going through a tough time, but with support, resilience, and self-care, you will get through this.\n"
